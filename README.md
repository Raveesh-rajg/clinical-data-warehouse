# 🏥 Clinical Data Warehouse System

 **HI 741 – Essential Programming for Health Informatics**  
By **Raveesh Raj Grandhi** | Date: 2025-05-05

This is a secure, role-based clinical data warehouse application built with Python. The system enables Admins, Clinicians, Nurses, and Management to log in through a GUI and perform various patient data operations based on their role. It uses CSV files for data storage and supports data visualization with Matplotlib.

 How to Run

1. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Launch the GUI
From your project root:

 - python -m src.ui 


## Role-Based Features
Role	Features
Admin	Count the number of patient visits on a specific date
Clinician/Nurse	Add, remove, and retrieve patient records; attach clinical notes; export data to CSV
Management	Visualize yearly visit trends; generate and save bar chart as visits_by_year.png

## Data Management
All core patient and note data is stored in the data/ folder.

Exported patient records and charts are saved in the outputs/ folder.

All operations are GUI-driven using role-specific access.

File paths are relative for full cross-platform compatibility.

Login actions are tracked in outputs/usage_log.csv.

## Design Notes
Developed with Tkinter to provide a clean, user-friendly GUI.

Follows object-oriented principles with Patient, Visit, and Note classes.

Maintains modular code organization for easier grading, readability, and scalability.

## Built With
Python 3.x

Tkinter – for GUI interfaces

Matplotlib – for data visualizations

Pillow – for image rendering

CSV module – for structured file-based data handling
