# 🏥 Clinical Data Warehouse System

 **HI 741 – Essential Programming for Health Informatics**  
By **Raveesh Raj Grandhi** | Date: 2025-05-05

This is a secure, role-based clinical data warehouse application built with Python. The system enables Admins, Clinicians, Nurses, and Management to log in through a GUI and perform various patient data operations based on their role. It uses CSV files for data storage and supports data visualization with Matplotlib.

 Role-Based Features
 
 Role	Features:
-Admin	Count number of patient visits on a selected date
-Clinician/Nurse	Add/remove/retrieve patients, attach notes, export data to CSV
-Management	View visit trends by year and generate/save bar chart

 Data Management:

-All core patient and note data is stored in the data/ folder.
-Exported patient records and charts are saved to outputs/.
-Role-based actions are GUI-driven and CSV-based for portability.
-All file paths are relative (cross-platform compatible).

 Notes:

-Designed using Tkinter for intuitive GUI layout
-Object-oriented structure using Patient, Visit, Note classes
-Clean project organization for easy understanding and grading
